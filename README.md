# BSSTokenSimulation
Just a simple script that helps with finding out what mutation works best for token production. - WIP

matplotlib is optional, if not installed, it'll default to be turned off. this just plots the information gathered in the simulation.
there are toggles for this in the script itself.
WARNING - it HOGS memory.

You'll need to configure it to your own stats if you'd like, there is math required to find out some values, but a bunch of them are within the game itself
^^^ the variable names are self explanatory
