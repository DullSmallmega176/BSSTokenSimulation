# BSSTokenSimulation
Just a simple script that helps with finding out what mutation works best for token production. - WIP

You might need to install matplotlib for this script to work "this just plots the gathered information.
there are toggles for this in the script itself.
WARNING - it HOGS memory.

https://matplotlib.org/

there are comments to at least help but you'll need to know the script well to actually configure it.
this is just a personal project so don't expect anything more from it.
